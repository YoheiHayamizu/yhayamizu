I am a 5th-year Ph.D. student at Binghamton University and work under the supervision of Prof. Shiqi Zhang.
My research interests are Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Sequential Decision Making (SDM).

I am organizing the Human Robot Systems (HRS)-Reading Group at Binghamton University. This weekly meetings bring together students and faculty to explore cutting-edge developments in robotics, artificial intelligence, and human-robot interaction. Please contact me if interested in joining us. [Website](https://yoheihayamizu.github.io/hrs-reading-group/)

# Research Interests
## HRI
I focus on developing socially-grounded autonomous robots that perform various tasks by seamlessly interacting and navigating human-inhabited complex environments. These robots require advanced perception and contextual awareness to communicate effectively in human spaces. My work enhances their ability to respond dynamically to changing situations, facilitating natural and meaningful human-robot interactions. Recent projects include dialog systems that leverage spatial context and human personas for natural language synthesis.

## SDM
In the realm of SDM, I am captivated by the potential synergy between Reinforcement Learning (RL) and knowledge bases. These knowledge repositories can encompass action-oriented information, domain-specific insights contributed by humans, or even knowledge learned from LLMs. By integrating these resources and bridging the divide between learning approaches and knowledge representation, I aspire to augment the decision-making proficiency of robots across diverse scenarios.
