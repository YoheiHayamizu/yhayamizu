I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student at Binghamton University and work under the supervision of Prof. Shiqi Zhang.
My research interests are Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Sequential Decision Making (SDM).

# Research Interests
## HRI
My HRI research focuses on the development of socially-inspired mobile robots designed for seamless interaction while navigating complex environments. Because these robots are physically present in human space, they require a high degree of perception and contextual understanding for effective communication. By leveraging context awareness with respect to human interaction and navigation, these robots can respond appropriately to dynamic situations and facilitate more natural and meaningful human-robot interactions. Recent work has dealt with advanced dialog navigation, including natural language synthesis using spatial context and human personas.

## SDM
In the realm of SDM, I am captivated by the potential synergy between Reinforcement Learning (RL) and knowledge bases. These knowledge repositories can encompass action-oriented information, domain-specific insights contributed by humans, or even knowledge learned from LLMs. By integrating these resources and bridging the divide between learning approaches and knowledge representation, I aspire to augment the decision-making proficiency of robots across diverse scenarios.
