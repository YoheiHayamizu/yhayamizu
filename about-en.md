My research interests are Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) with Sequential Decision
Making. I am currently working on the Visual-Dialogue Navigation system that can
adapt to spatial information and user intentions by interacting with humans in a
physical environment to improve the robot's persuasion ability. I am also interested
in leveraging the synergy between Reinforcement Learning and Automated Planning
to bridge the gap between learning approach and knowledge representation and reasoning.
