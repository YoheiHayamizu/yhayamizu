I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student at Binghamton University and work under the supervision of Prof. Shiqi Zhang.
My research interests are Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Sequential Decision Making (SDM).

### HRI
I study social-influence mobile robots, which are designed to interact with humans while navigating their environments. To be effective at social influence, these robots must not only accomplish their tasks but also establish enduring connections with humans. Unlike conventional chatbot assistants, social-influence mobile robots are physically present, requiring them to perceive and comprehend their surroundings to communicate adeptly. Utilizing context awareness enables these robots to react fittingly to ongoing situations, resulting in more natural and meaningful interactions.

### SDM
In the realm of Sequential Decision Making (SDM), I am captivated by the potential synergy between Reinforcement Learning (RL) and knowledge bases. These repositories of knowledge can encompass action-oriented information, domain-specific insights contributed by humans, or even knowledge gleaned from Large Language Models. By integrating these resources and bridging the divide between learning approaches and knowledge representation and reasoning techniques, I aspire to augment the decision-making proficiencies of robots across diverse scenarios.
