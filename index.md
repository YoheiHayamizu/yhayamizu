I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student at Binghamton University and work under the supervision of Prof. Shiqi Zhang.
My research interests are Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Sequential Decision Making (SDM).
I work on Social-Influence Dialogue Navigation systems that can adapt to spatial information and user intentions by interacting with humans in a
physical environment to improve the robot's persuasion ability.
I am also interested in leveraging the synergy between Reinforcement Learning and Automated Planning to bridge the gap between learning approaches and knowledge representation and reasoning approaches.
