I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student at Binghamton University and work under the supervision of Prof. Shiqi Zhang.
My research interests are Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Sequential Decision Making(SDM).
I work on Visual-Dialogue Navigation systems that can adapt to spatial information and user intentions by interacting with humans in a
physical environment to improve the robot's persuasion ability.
I am also interested in leveraging the synergy between Reinforcement Learning and Automated Planning to bridge the gap between learning approaches and knowledge representation and reasoning approaches.

<!--
I research on a Dialog-Navigation problem. We learned Dialog and Navigation in this cource. Navigation is a combination research on those two conventional research. In our research, we focus on the robot which can convince a human to make a good decision in a scenario where the human and the robot move around and they sometimes conversate.


As you learned in this cource, dialog is conducted in a loop of human and robot. Navigation is that a robot moves around an environment. In conventional research, dialog took place in a fixed location, and neither a human nor a robot move. Dialog-Navigation is a combination research on those two conventional research. There are two types of researches on Dialog-Navigation.
