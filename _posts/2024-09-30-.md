# Publication
Our collaborative paper, titled **[Emergence of continuous signals as shared symbols through emergent communication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10644981/)**, was published in the proceedings of **IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning (ICDL) 2024**.

This work represents an exciting collaboration between researchers in Japan and the US, exploring how artificial agents can develop shared symbolic communication systems.

## Research Overview
Understanding how communication systems emerge and evolve is fundamental to both artificial intelligence and cognitive science. Our research investigates how continuous signals can emerge as shared symbols through multi-agent interactions, providing insights into the origins of symbolic communication.

## Key Contributions
- Novel framework for studying emergent symbolic communication
- Analysis of continuous signal evolution into discrete symbols
- Multi-agent experimental setup and validation
- Theoretical insights into communication emergence

## Collaborative Impact
This international collaboration between Ritsumeikan University (Japan) and SUNY Binghamton (US) demonstrates the power of cross-cultural research in advancing our understanding of communication and cognition.

## Applications
- Multi-agent systems
- Human-robot interaction
- Language evolution studies
- Cognitive modeling
