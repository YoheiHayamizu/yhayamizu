# Publication
Our paper, titled **[Guiding Robot Exploration in Reinforcement Learning via Automated Planning](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/16011)**, was published in the proceedings of **International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) 2021**.

This work bridges the gap between symbolic automated planning and reinforcement learning, providing an effective approach to guide robot exploration in complex environments.

## Research Problem
Reinforcement learning agents often struggle with exploration in large, sparse reward environments. Our research introduces automated planning techniques to provide structured guidance for exploration, significantly improving learning efficiency.

## Key Innovations
- Integration of symbolic planning with reinforcement learning
- Guided exploration strategy using planning heuristics
- Theoretical analysis of convergence properties
- Experimental validation on robot navigation tasks

## Results
- Faster convergence compared to standard RL methods
- Improved sample efficiency
- Better performance in complex navigation scenarios
- Successful deployment on real Segway-based robot
