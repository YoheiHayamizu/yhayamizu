# Publication
Our paper, titled **From Woofs to Words: Towards Intelligent Robotic Guide Dogs with Verbal Communication**, has been accepted for publication at **AAAI 2026**.

This groundbreaking work explores the development of intelligent robotic guide dogs that can communicate verbally with their human partners, representing a significant step forward in assistive robotics and accessibility technology.

## About the Project
Traditional guide dogs communicate through physical cues and behaviors. Our research introduces verbal communication capabilities to robotic guide dogs, enabling richer interaction and improved navigation assistance for visually impaired individuals.

## Key Features
- Verbal communication between robot and human
- Advanced navigation and obstacle avoidance
- Contextual awareness and decision-making
- Real-world testing and validation

## Recognition
This project was featured on the **Watson Review Cover** (Summer 2025) for its significant contributions to assistive robotics and potential societal impact.
