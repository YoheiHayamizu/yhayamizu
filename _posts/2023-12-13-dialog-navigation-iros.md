# Publication
Our paper, titled **[Learning Joint Policies for Human-Robot Dialog and Co-Navigation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10341663/)**, was published in the proceedings of **IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2023**.

This research addresses the challenging problem of enabling robots to simultaneously engage in natural dialog with humans while navigating collaboratively toward shared goals.

## Research Overview
Traditional robotic systems treat dialog and navigation as separate modules. Our work presents a unified approach that learns joint policies for both dialog management and navigation control, enabling more natural and effective human-robot collaboration.

## Key Contributions
- Unified framework for dialog and navigation
- Joint policy learning approach
- Experimental validation in simulated and real-world scenarios
- Improved task completion rates and user satisfaction

## Applications
- Service robots in public spaces
- Collaborative delivery systems
- Assistive robotics for navigation support
- Interactive tour guide robots
