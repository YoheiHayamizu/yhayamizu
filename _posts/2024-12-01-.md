# Publication
Our paper, titled **[Learning quadruped locomotion policies using logical rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10969)**, was published in the proceedings of **International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) 2024**.

This work demonstrates how logical rules can be effectively integrated with reinforcement learning to improve quadruped robot locomotion, combining symbolic reasoning with continuous control.

## Research Overview
Quadruped locomotion is a challenging problem in robotics that requires coordinated control of multiple legs while maintaining balance and adapting to various terrains. Our research introduces a novel approach that leverages logical rules to guide the learning process, making it more efficient and interpretable.

## Key Innovation
Traditional reinforcement learning approaches for locomotion often require extensive trial-and-error learning. By incorporating logical rules that encode domain knowledge about quadruped gaits and stability principles, our method achieves:

- **Faster Learning:** Reduced training time through guided exploration
- **Better Stability:** Improved balance and robustness during locomotion
- **Interpretable Policies:** Clear understanding of decision-making process
- **Transferable Knowledge:** Rules that generalize across different scenarios

## Technical Contributions
- Integration of symbolic logical rules with continuous RL policies
- Novel reward shaping mechanism based on locomotion principles
- Demonstration on both simulated and real quadruped robots
- Comprehensive evaluation across various terrains and conditions

## Applications and Impact
This research has important implications for:
- Autonomous quadruped robots in challenging environments
- Search and rescue operations
- Inspection and monitoring tasks
- Advancing the integration of symbolic and subsymbolic AI

## Project Resources
Our comprehensive project website includes videos, code, and additional technical details to support reproducibility and further research.
