# Publication
Our paper, titled **[Beta Distribution-based XCS Classifier System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9870314/)**, was published in the proceedings of **IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2022**.

This work introduces a novel approach to Learning Classifier Systems by incorporating beta distribution for improved rule representation and adaptation.

## Research Innovation
Traditional XCS (eXtended Classifier System) uses fixed condition representations that may not optimally capture the underlying data patterns. Our research introduces beta distribution-based representations that can dynamically adapt to the data characteristics.

## Key Contributions
- **Beta Distribution Integration:** Novel use of beta distribution for condition representation in XCS
- **Adaptive Rule Learning:** Enhanced ability to learn and adapt rules for complex patterns
- **Improved Performance:** Demonstrated superior performance on benchmark problems
- **Theoretical Foundation:** Solid mathematical framework for the proposed approach

## Technical Advancement
The beta distribution provides a flexible and mathematically principled way to represent fuzzy conditions in learning classifier systems, enabling better generalization and more effective learning in continuous domains.

## Impact and Applications
- Pattern recognition and classification
- Adaptive control systems
- Data mining and knowledge discovery
- Evolutionary machine learning

## Collaboration
This work represents a productive collaboration with my colleagues, demonstrating the power of combining different expertise areas in machine learning and evolutionary computation.
